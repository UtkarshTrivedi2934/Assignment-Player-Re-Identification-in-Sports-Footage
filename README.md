# ‚öΩ Football Broadcast Player Detection & Re-Identification using YOLOv11

This repository presents a system for detecting and re-identifying players in football match broadcasts. The model is custom-trained on an annotated dataset using YOLOv11 and includes a tracking pipeline for player association across video frames.

## üìÇ Project Overview

This project enables:
- ‚ö° Real-time detection of players, referee, football, and objects
- üè∑Ô∏è Re-identification of players across frames using tracking
- üé• Generation of output videos with bounding boxes and identities
- üìÅ Saving detection and tracking results as `.pkl` files

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UtkarshTrivedi2934/Assignment-Player-Re-Identification-in-Sports-Footage.git
cd Assignment-Player-Re-Identification-in-Sports-Footage
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

# On Unix/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue During requirements.txt Installation**
If you encounter the following error while installing dependencies:
```bash
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch>=1.7.0 (from ultralytics->-r requirements.txt)
No matching distribution found for torch>=1.7.0
```
*‚úÖ Fix: Ensure the following conditions are met before running pip install -r requirements.txt:*

- You are using Python 3.8 to 3.11 (preferably 64-bit)
- You have updated pip to the latest version

**Or install manually:**
```bash
pip install opencv-python torch torchvision numpy pillow scikit-learn ultralytics
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

**Tracking and Player Re-Identification**

```bash
After replacing with your trained model:
model = YOLO("model/best.pt")  # fine-tuned YOLOv11 model
results = model.track(source="input_video/15sec_input_720p.mp4", save=True, persist=True)

```
- Annotated video with player IDs: runs/track/predict/
- Frame-wise results or Re-ID metadata: tracker_stubs/player_detection.pkl
---

**üìå Output:**

- Players and referees are marked with consistent Re-ID numbers (as shown in the output image).
- Objects such as the football are accurately detected and tracked.
- Frame-by-frame tracking metadata is saved in tracker_stubs/player_detection.pkl.

### üßæ Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics
- Torch + TorchVision
- Torchreid
- scikit-learn
- Pillow
